I'm thrilled to announce a personal project I've been building: a Flutter mobile app that lets me write and manage blog posts for my GitHub Pages site directly from my phone! This app perfectly complements my existing Angular-based blog, giving me complete freedom to write and publish content wherever inspiration strikes.

✨ What This App Does

This isn't just another note-taking app — it's specifically designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Pages personal blogs. Now I can:

· 📝 Draft new blog posts during my morning commute
· 👁️ Preview posts in real-time before publishing
· 📱 Manage my content without needing a laptop
· 🎯 Focus on writing with a clean, distraction-free interface

🛠 Built for My Workflow

The app lives within my existing blog repository at flutter_blog_writer/blog_writer_app/ and is built to work perfectly with my setup:

· Flutter Framework: For a beautiful, native mobile experience on both Android and iOS
· Direct Integration: Works with my Angular-based GitHub Pages blog
· Recent Enhancement: Just added post preview functionality (December 2025 update)
· Seamless Sync: Posts integrate directly with my existing content structure
